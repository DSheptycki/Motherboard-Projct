          <h2>What is a Chipset</h2>
          <p>
            The motherboard chipset is an intergrated component that works with
            specific CPU generations. It transfers and communicates information
            and data between connected storage and expansion devices.
          </p>
          <h2>What does it do?</h2>
          <p>
            The Chipset Allows the CPU to communicate and interact with the
            other components of the computer, and it allows data to be shared
            with all the components that need it across your tower.
          </p>
          <h2>Northbridge Chipset</h2>
          <p>
            The Northbridge chipset is the main hub of memory and information
            control, it is located near the top of the motherboard and
            communicates faster, it's connected directly to the CPU, it manages
            the communications between the CPU and other parts of the
            motherboard. The north bridge is situated near to the processor for
            easy access and connects things like RAM and AGP.
          </p>
          <h2>Southbride Chipset</h2>
          <p>
            The Southbridge chipset is the main hub for input / output
            functioning, it is located underneath the PCI bus of the motherboard
            and communicates slower. It's connected through the north bridge to
            the CPU, it manages all of the input and output of the computer. The
            southbridge is positioned near the PCI and connects things like PCI
            and USB.
