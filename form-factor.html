          <h2>What is Form Factor</h2>
          <p>
            Form Factor is the size and avaliable components that belong to a
            motherboard. Selecting Form Factor is very important because of
            compatibility and what's ideal, you don't want to purchase / use a
            motherboard that has tons of extra unused components or doesn't fit
            into your case.
          </p>
          <h2>ATX Form Factor</h2>
          <p>
            The characteristics of a ATX form factor, replacing AT form factors
            has; Intergrated I/O port connectors, Intergrated PS/2 mouse
            connector, Reduced drive bay interference, Reduced expansion card
            interference, better power supply connector, “Soft Power” support,
            3.3V power support, better air flow and Improved upgradability.
          </p>
          <h3>Micro ATX</h3>
          <p>
            The characteristics of a Micro ATX form factor are identical to the
            normal ATX, but the micro ATX is 25% smaller compared to the typical
            244 x 244 mm ATX. It supports all the same as ATX motherboards but
            typically cuts back on a few extra components to save space.
          </p>
          <h2>ITX Form Factor</h2>
          <p>
            The ITX form factor is a style of small motherboard that is often
            used in low cost small setups, such as small computers and other
            things along the lines as it is cost effective, and compatible with
            a lot of components.
          </p>
          <h3>Mini ITX Form Factor</h3>
          <p>
            The Mini ITX form factor is nearly identical to the regular ITX but
            with some differences, the Mini ITX measures 17 cm x 17cm (6.75” x
            6.75”). usually has two memory slots, 1 PCI Express or mini-PCI
            slot, several USB ports, and one network port. Occasionally a
            Mini-ITX will include a onboard VGA or HDMI port.
